# Development

Install dependencies and compile:

```sh
npm install
npm run compile
```

Open this folder in VS Code and run the Extension Development Host.

## Configuration

Configure the endpoint and optional request headers in VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "ollama.endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:11434",
  "ollama.headers": {}
}
```

VS Code can also pass provider configuration through `chatLanguageModels.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "vendor": "ollama-extension",
    "name": "Ollama",
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:11434",
    "models": ["qwen3.6"],
    "headers": {}
  }
]
```

If `models` is omitted, the extension lists every model returned by `/api/tags`.
Provider configuration from VS Code takes precedence over workspace settings.

## Package a VSIX

Build the extension package:

```sh
npm install
npm run compile
npx @vscode/vsce package --out ollama-0.0.1.vsix
```

Install the packaged VSIX:

```sh
code --install-extension ollama-0.0.1.vsix
```

You can also install a VSIX from VS Code by running `Extensions: Install from
VSIX...` from the Command Palette.
